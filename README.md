This is a Classification problem. You can import dataset from the [following link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anindya2906/fashion-mnist-classification)  to replicate the same results and follow along the experiement. We'll use Keras to build a Dense Neural Network to solve this problem. We'll also explore how to use Keras' Sequential, and Functional APIs to build our Neural Network.

## Instructions for Installation:

**Dependencies:** : You'll need to install below dependencies to run this project.

* numpy: 1.18.1
* pandas: 1.0.1
* matplotlib: 3.5.3
* sklearn: 0.22.1
