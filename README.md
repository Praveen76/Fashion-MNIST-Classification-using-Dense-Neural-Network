# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-using-Dense-Neural-Network

**Data**:
Training Dataset has 60K samples, and test dataset has 10K samples. Each sample or image is 28*28 grayscale image. The dataset has 10 classes.

This is a Classification problem. You can import dataset from the [following link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anindya2906/fashion-mnist-classification)  to replicate the same results and follow along the experiement. We'll use Keras to build a Dense Neural Network to solve this problem. We'll also explore how to use Keras' Sequential, and Functional APIs to build our Neural Network.
